This is the example FTD Props file, that will be included with the build. Change the below path to your valid FTD install location.
Create a file with the same name as this one, but with just "FTD.props" as the name and file extension. 
Then copy and paste the below XML into the file, ignoring the dashed lines.
Make sure you updated the directory location.
