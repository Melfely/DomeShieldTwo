A list of things to do on the Dome Shield. Mark complete or incomplete with a Y / N (as in, "Is this done?")
Some abbreviations: Energy Cost (EC), Armour Class (AC), Diverted Energy (DE),

-Change armour class system:						 Needs Testing
	-Change slider to set AC						Y
	-Energy cost (EC) for AC is based on set AC		Y
	-EC is lowered by Hardeners						Y
	-Hardener effectiveness based on MaxEnergy		Y

-Adjust Regen System:								
	-Don't let slider bring DE below 90%			Y
	-Better balancing / softcaps at high regen		Y
	-Prevent UI Flickers (Time between modes)		Y

-Readjust card system:
	-Significantly lower card drawbacks				Y
	-Slightly lower card buffs						Y
	-Consider combining certain damage types?*		N
		*This would be to make cards more useful by affecting more than one damage type, increasing the likelyhood a player chooses to use one

-Tune Spoofers:
	-Reduce EP cost									Y
	-Increase effect								Y

-Double check Plasma's hit code
	-Fix high speed shots clipping thru shield		Maybe fixed? Probably needs a full rework
		-To this effect, we could probably rework fire's hit code just in case
